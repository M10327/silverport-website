						<h1>Quickstart Guide</h1>
						<p>Welcome to our quickstart guide! Several things on this server are changed from vanilla, so here is a list of all the most important things new players should know about.</p>
						<p>First off, please familiarize yourself with the <a href="rules.html">rules</a> and <a href="commands.html">commands</a><p>
						<p>Like most servers, we have the usual tpa home and kits. You can accept and deny tpa requests using keybinds. Check your controls for CodeHotkey 1 and 2 for accept and deny respectively.</p>
						<p>We have a simplified ammo system using a new item called the "Universal Magazine." Loading this into most guns will make it replace itself with the normal mag at full ammo.</p>
						<p>Most guns and all melee weapons do not drop on death. You will get a notification when pulling out a gun whether it drops or not.</p>
						<p>Claim flags are <font color="#860e0e">extremely important</font>. If your base is not protected by a claim flag, it slowly loses health until it's completely destroyed.</p>
						<p>All players are able to spawn vehicles and have access to a garage system to store their vehicles in. More info about those in <a href="commands.html">commands</a>.</p>
						<p>Airdrops and horde beacons on here are not vanilla, so it's recommended to seek them out for rare weapons and gear.</p>
						<p>High tech components are extremely rare and drop at every loot spawn. Use them to craft rare weapons that you're having a hard time finding normally.</p>
						<p>Most vanilla weapons have their stats changed. Check their item description to see what is different about them.</p>
						<p>You can find mystical clothing dye commonly in clothing stores. Craft this with spec ops gear to turn it into kevlar. Kevlar can be turned back into any spec ops gear you need, along with a lot of custom cosmetics.</p>
