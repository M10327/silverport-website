						<h1>Quickstart Guide</h1>
						<p>Welcome to our quickstart guide! Several things on this server are changed from vanilla, so I have compiled a list of all the most important things new players should know about.</p>
						<p>First off, please familiarize yourself with the <a href="rules.html">rules</a> and <a href="commands.html">commands</a><p>
						<p>Like most servers, we have the usual tpa home and kits. The only big difference with these is that you can accept/deny tpa requests with your comma and period keys on your keyboard. (rebind these in plugin settings under "plugin hotkeys")</p>
						<p>One of our biggest systems is a simplified ammo system. You should spawn with an item called the "Universale Magazine" in your inventory. Loading this into most guns will make it replace itself with the normal mag at full ammo.</p>
						<p>Another important system is that not every gun drops on death. Melee weapons never drop, and most guns never drop either. You will get a notification when pulling out a gun whether it drops or not.</p>
						<p>Claim flags are more important on here than ever. If your base is not protected by a claim flag, it slowly loses health until it's completely destroyed.</p>
						<p>All players are able to spawn vehicles and have access to a garage system to store their vehicles in. More info about those in <a href="commands.html">commands</a>.</p>
						<p>Airdrops and horde beacons on here are not vanilla, so it's recommended to seek them out for rare weapons and gear</p>
						<p>High tech components are extremely rare and drop at every loot spawn. Use them to craft rare weapons that you're having a hard time finding normally.</p>
						<p>Many vanilla weapons have their stats changed. Check their item description to see what is different about them.</p>
